# AlphaZeroSC2

>The first time, I want to try this by using the pySC2, but it is hard to create a zero-sum game in mini-game buildmarines. So I have to restructure the whole game by myself, you can see the details in bmgame.py.

>The mini-game buildmarines in order to solve an optimization problem of the production, but it only has one player. If I set another player in the game, and set some limit of the parameters, it can be transferred to a zero-sum game environment. And I can try to use MCTS to solve this problem.

**Say Goodbye to the pySC2** (PS: it wastes too much of my time, nearly a month)

ğŸ˜šğŸ˜šğŸ˜š

**Say Hello to my bmgame** (PS: I try my best to restructrue the whole game logic, also about the inner parameters)

Maybe I need to explain why I want to do this. First, I like the SC2 gameğŸ˜‹. Second, it's my course work ğŸ˜¥(solve a zero-sum game by using MCTS).

## TODO
* reset MCTS in new game environment
* train set in new game environment
* maybe the parallel training set
